Happy Hoofs Riding School

This is a site built for a fictional riding school. The aim of the desiggn is to promote the great riding around the school.
The site was built using HTML 5 and CSS3. I used bootstrap 4 for the layout but 99% of the styling was done in a custom style sheet.
The calendar was found on the Internet and is courtesy of Jamie. Apart from some minor adjustments to the CSS this is as coded.
Images were taken from google or cut from assisting images using photoshop. Git was used for version control.
