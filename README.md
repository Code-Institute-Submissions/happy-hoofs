Happy Hoofs Riding School

This is a site built for a fictional riding school. The aim of the desiggn is to promote the great riding around the school.
The site was built using HTML 5 and CSS3. I used bootstrap 4 for the layout but 99% of the styling was done in a custom style sheet.
The calendar was found on the Internet and is courtesy of Jamie. Apart from some minor adjustments to the CSS this is as coded.
Images were taken from google or cut from exsisting images using photoshop. Git was used for version control.
Modals and nav styling was from bootstrap with additional customisation in CCS3.

Deseign

I developed a design document and used the five plans as the basis for the document. I used some friends as fake owners to help with the
design process. I ofund this process useful and ended up making changes to my original ideas after use cases.

Build

At first I found this tricky but realised if I followed mobile first development it is much easier. After building the original
skeleton I was left with numerous issues that were tricky to unpick. Mainly caused by reducing screen sizes. I then started afresh and
was much more successfull.

I found layout with bootsrap hard at first but learnt as I went through the project. I had numerous issues with centralising and layout
which I managed to overcome. I also used bootstrap for the modals but worked out how to fire them from a menu link.

I struggled to find a calendar plugin I could use and after many trials I decided to use one designed by Jamie. This was really flexible 
so perfect for implementing on a heavily styled page without any impact. I was trying to use using any JS in the project.


I made some minor changes to the design as I went through. These were mainly for page body stuff. The nav and concepts pretty much followed the design.
I also had to tinker with colors on the footer to get clarity over the image.

Left out of scope staff details as this was more content based and can be added to one of the core pages developed. Mainly due to lack of time

One particulary tricky problem to solve was a margin being forced on the right hand side of the page on smaller resolutions.
I managed to fix it by ensuring nothing overflowed the page and it is caused by nested rows.



Testing
 
 I went through each page to check links worked. I checked each page for spelling and rendering. I also checked for consistent application
 of the design standards.
 
 I checked the site on various devicesd and found the site looked horrible on XL screens. This was not reflecting during development
 but was fairly easy to fix. I have tried the site in different browsers, firefox, chrome, safari and expolrer with no major issues.
 
 I have not gone to far back on browser versions and would do so in future
 
 I asked friends and family to carry out some UAT for me as well which resulted in some minor changes to layout


Deployment

I deployed the site to Github at the testing phase

Version Control

I used git from the start of the project and this worked well

Lessons Learnt

I would make my designs more detailed in future as I found with a clear idea build was much quicker. This would also
impact my class names. I would like to me more systematic in class names and maybe consider these mmore at the design stage
 I also find laying out the basic bootstrap structure with colors is a good trick to get the basic design right.
